# Create React App Starter with Router, Material UI, 

## About:

This repo contains the starter setup that I always spend way too much time setting up and gathering:

- React with Create React App https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- TypeScript
- ESlint and Prettier with Autoformmating in VSCode enabled
  - Thanks to https://github.com/robertcoopercode https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project
- Router (with a couple sample pages) https://reactrouter.com/web/api/BrowserRouter
- Material UI https://next.material-ui.com/


## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui):


Install it and run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```


**Note:**
For all packages in package.json, I used "latest" as the version.

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).
